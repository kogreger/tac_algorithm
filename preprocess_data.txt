Pre-process Data for TaC-Algorithm
----------------------------------

1. Study area
	1.1 Download study area outline from OSM
	1.2 Import study area outline into database (cf. comment for perseus.temp.hamburg_outline)
	1.3 Manually check for islands and exclaves

2. Road network
	2.1 Download road network data from OSM
	2.2 Import road network data into database
	2.3 Classify road network incl. study area outline (cf. osm_road_classes.txt)
	2.4 Clean topology of classified road network (can also be done in PostGIS >2.0)
		2.4.1 v.ogr.in.qgis
		2.4.2 v.clean.break)
		2.4.3 delete and re-import to database

3. Generate cells from OSM road network data
	3.1 Polygonize road network (can also be done in PostGIS >2.0)
		3.1.1 QGIS > Processing > Toolbox > Polygonize
		3.1.2 Import cells from SHP file into database
	3.2 clip to study area
		DELETE FROM temp.hamburg_cells c 
		USING temp.hamburg_outline o 
		WHERE ST_Disjoint(ST_PointOnSurface(c.the_geom), o.the_geom);
	3.3 derive relationships between neighboring cells
		
	3.4 derive distances between neighboring cells
