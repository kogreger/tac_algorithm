Pre-process Data for TaC-Algorithm
----------------------------------

1. Study area
	1.1 Download study area outline from OSM
	1.2 Import study area outline into database (cf. comment for perseus.temp.hamburg_outline)
	1.3 Manually check for islands and exclaves

2. Road network
	2.1 Download road network data from OSM
	2.2 Import road network data into database
	2.3 Classify road network incl. study area outline (cf. osm_road_classes.txt)
	2.4 Clean topology of classified road network (can also be done in PostGIS >2.0)
		2.4.1 v.ogr.in.qgis
		2.4.2 v.clean.break)
		2.4.3 delete and re-import to database

3. Generate cells from OSM road network data
	3.1 Polygonize road network (can also be done in PostGIS >2.0)
		3.1.1 QGIS > Processing > Toolbox > Polygonize
		3.1.2 Import cells from SHP file into database
	3.2 clip to study area
		DELETE FROM temp.hamburg_cells c 
		USING temp.hamburg_outline o 
		WHERE ST_Disjoint(ST_PointOnSurface(c.the_geom), o.the_geom);
	3.3 derive distance and relationship between neighboring cells
		CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE temp.hamburg_relationships AS
		SELECT c1.gid a, c2.gid b, 
			ST_Distance_Sphere(ST_PointOnSurface(c1.the_geom), ST_PointOnSurface(c2.the_geom)) dst, 
			MAX(r.tac_class)::integer obst 
		FROM temp.hamburg_cells c1, temp.hamburg_cells c2, temp.hamburg_roads r 
		WHERE c1.gid != c2.gid AND 
			(ST_Covers(c1.the_geom, r.the_geom) AND 
			ST_Covers(c2.the_geom, r.the_geom)) 
		GROUP BY c1.gid, c2.gid 
		ORDER BY c1.gid, c2.gid;

4. Seeds
	4.1 Import seeds
	4.2 Check for multiple seeds per cell
		4.2.1 QGIS > Vector > Analysis Tools > Points in polygon
		4.2.2 Symbolize resulting SHP file using check_seed_conflict.qml
		4.2.3 Manually delete unnecessary seeds (should be merge)
